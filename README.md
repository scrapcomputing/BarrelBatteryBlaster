# Barrel Battery Blaster

Barrel Battery Blaster is a small PCB for replacing old rechargeable barrel-type CMOS batteries with non-rechargeable CR2032 Lithium batteries.
Such barrel batteries were quite common on vintage computer motherboards up until the 486 era.
These barrel batteries tend to leak, damaging the motherboard and the surrounding components.
